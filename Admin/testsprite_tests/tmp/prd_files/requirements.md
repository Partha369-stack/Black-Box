# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature specification outlines the comprehensive transformation of the existing IoT vending machine system from a development prototype to a production-ready, enterprise-grade solution. The system currently consists of a multi-tenant architecture with admin dashboard, backend API, multiple vending machine web interfaces, and ESP32-based hardware controllers for order dispatching and inventory management.

The production readiness initiative will address critical security vulnerabilities, implement proper database solutions, establish monitoring and logging systems, containerize the application, create a robust CI/CD pipeline, and enhance the IoT device management capabilities while maintaining the existing functionality and user experience. Special attention will be given to ESP32 integration, device provisioning, and the machine onboarding workflow.

2. WHEN caching is implemented THEN frequently accessed data SHALL be cached to improve performance
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL be optimized for performance
4. WHEN file uploads occur THEN the system SHALL handle large files efficiently
5. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN the system SHALL support multiple concurrent connections
6. WHEN load testing is performed THEN the system SHALL handle the expected production load

### Requirement 7: CI/CD Pipeline and Code Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated testing and deployment processes, so that code changes can be safely and efficiently deployed to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN automated tests SHALL run and must pass before deployment
2. WHEN builds are created THEN the system SHALL automatically build and test all components
3. WHEN deployment occurs THEN it SHALL be automated with rollback capabilities
4. WHEN code quality is checked THEN linting and security scanning SHALL be enforced
