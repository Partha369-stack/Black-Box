# 🔧 BlackBox Landing Page - Deployment Fix

## ❌ Issue Identified

Your BlackBox Landing Page was failing to deploy on Railway due to a `path-to-regexp` compatibility issue:

```
TypeError: Missing parameter name at 1: https://git.new/pathToRegexpError
    at name (/app/node_modules/path-to-regexp/dist/index.js:73:19)
```

## 🎯 Root Cause

- **Express.js 5.1.0** uses `path-to-regexp` version 8.x
- **path-to-regexp 8.x** has breaking changes and stricter route pattern validation
- This caused parsing errors when Express tried to process routes

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Downgraded Express.js
- **Before**: `express: "^5.1.0"`
- **After**: `express: "^4.19.2"`

### 2. Updated Dependencies
- Ran `npm install` to install Express 4.x and compatible dependencies
- This automatically resolved the `path-to-regexp` compatibility issue

### 3. Enhanced Railway Configuration
- Updated `railway.json` with explicit build commands
- Added health check configuration for better deployment monitoring

### 4. Tested Locally
- ✅ Build successful: `npm run build`
- ✅ Server runs without errors: `node server.js`
- ✅ No more `path-to-regexp` errors

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

Your BlackBox Landing Page is now ready to deploy on Railway:

1. **Commit changes** to your Git repository
2. **Push to Railway** - it will automatically deploy
3. **Monitor deployment** - no more crashes expected

## 📁 Files Changed

- `package.json` - Express version downgrade
- `railway.json` - Enhanced deployment configuration
- `package-lock.json` - Updated automatically

## 🎉 Expected Result

- ✅ Successful deployment on Railway
- ✅ Landing page accessible at your Railway URL
- ✅ Contact form working
- ✅ All routes functioning properly

**Deployment Status**: 🟢 **READY TO DEPLOY**
